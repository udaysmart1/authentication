2.  **jsonwebtoken**

3. **body-parser**


4. **bcryptjs**


5. **express-validator**


6.**express**

### 3. Setup MongoDB Database

We will be using MongoDB Database to store our users. You can use either a cloud MongoDB server or a local MongoDB server. 

In this CodeLab, we will be using a Cloud MongoDB server known as [mLab](https://mlab.com/).

So, First, go ahead and signup on mLab. And follow the below steps. 

1. After successful signup, Click on **Create New** Button on home page. 

2. Now, choose any cloud provider for example AWS. In the **Plan Type** choose the free SandBox and then Click on the **Continue** button at the bottom right.

3. Select the region(any) and click continue. 

4. Enter a DB name(any). I am using **node-auth**. Click continue and then submit the order on the next page. Don't worry it's free of cost. 

5. Now, You will be re-directed to the homepage. Select your DB i.e node-auth.

6. Copy the standard MongoDB URI.  


7. Now, you need to add a user to your database. From the 5 tabs below, click on **Users** and add a user by clicking on **Add Database User**.

Now, you have got your database user. Replace the <dbuser> && <dbpassword> with your DB username and password. 

```
mongodb+srv://udaysmart:<password>@cluster0.qnudkim.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

```

So, the Mongo Server Address(MongoURI) should look like this. Don't try to connect on my MongoURI. It's just a dummy username & password. :smile::smile:

```
mongodb+srv://smart:Smn812345@cluster0.qnudkim.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

```
> Now, you have the mongoURI you are ready to connect your **user-auth** app to the database. Please follow the below steps.

#### How to Test the application? 

PostMan is required for Testing the API. If you don't have PostMan installed first, install it. 

1. First, register the user or login if you are already registered. 

2. From step 1, you will get a token. Copy that token and put in the **header**. 

3. Hit Submit
